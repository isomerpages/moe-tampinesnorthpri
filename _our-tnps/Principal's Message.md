To be a light for one and all .<br>
Steadfast and worthy we’ll want to be,<br>
	A gleaming example for all to see.'</em></center></strong>

This is an excerpt from our school song. At TNPS, we inspire our students to be the best that they can be, providing them opportunities to discover and hone their strengths. Guided by our school motto ‘True and Noble’, our students epitomise the school values of Responsibility, Respect, Resilience, Integrity and Care.

  

As we witness the changing global landscape and the development of digitalisation, there is an urgency to equip our students with the 21st CC competencies and skills. As the school moves to its next milestone, we aspire our students to be “**Confident Learners, Critical Thinkers, Rooted in Values**”. With the refreshed vision, we aim to develop our students to have a positive attitude towards learning, be self-directed and intrinsically motivated.

  

**Character Development** will continue to be the school’s focus. A students’ character provides the foundation for their growth and development. It undergirds the principles that would guide the individual in their decision making process in life. Adapted from “Educating for Education’ by Thomas Lickona, a V3 approach; Values Inculcation, Values Action and Values Reflection is adopted to develop the core values of ‘Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Care and Integrity’ in the school. Through the explicit teaching of values, varied platforms are identified for students to internalise these values.

  

Taking reference from our Singapore Green Plan 2030, a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development, our **Learning for Life Programme (LLP), G4 Life**, focuses on the ‘Character development through Environment Education’. Anchored on the school values of Care, Respect, Resilience and Responsibility, our G4Life aims to inculcate in our students the care and responsibility for the environment through raising awareness on environmental issues and educating students on the impact of man’s actions on the environment. It seeks to build a community where individuals do their part to show care and responsibility for the environment they live in through eco-friendly practices such as 6Rs (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repair, Rethink). Through these efforts, we want our students to understand sustainability and climate change, and feel empowered to take individual actions that will make a difference.

  

**Home-School Partnership** is critical in our student’s journey at TNPS. As parents, you are the first educators of your child’s life. Our students succeed when we work hand in hand to support students in learning self-management skills, taking responsibility and building resilience. Through our combined efforts, our students will develop the intrinsic motivation to learn, have a strong foundation grounded in values and resilience to achieve their aspirations.
