<p>The shape of the shield depicts a strong protection for the pupil holding
it. It shows a strong person with true and noble character depicted by
the bold colours of dark and light blue.</p>
<p>The "T" and "N" combination insignia on the shield stands for Tampines
North Primary School and also represents the True and Noble quality of
the pupil standing on the solid foundation of a good education from Tampines
North Primary School.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Flag</strong></h3>
<p>The school flag is divided into two parts: the upper part is yellow and
the lower part is light blue.</p>
<p>The school crest is in the centre of the flag. The two parts, the yellow
and the blue background depict a pupil's intellectual development and devotion
towards the community and the nation.</p>
<p>In the forefront emerges a shield (the School Badge), a strong protection
against the erosion of human values which are to be preserved and protected.</p>
<p>The 'T' and 'N' combination symbol shows a TRUE and NOBLE character to
be developed through pupil's primary education in Tampines North Primary
School.</p>
