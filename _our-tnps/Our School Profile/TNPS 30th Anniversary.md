<h3><strong>TNPS 30th Anniversary</strong></h3>
<p>In 2024, we celebrated our 30th Anniversary, themed ‘<strong>Scaling to New Heights</strong>’.
Our celebrations marked the next milestone for the school, celebrating
our students, staff and parents.</p>
<p>We started off our celebrations on Sat, 27 April, at our Tampines Eco
Green, situated at our backyard. 30 trees, representing our 30 years journey,
were planted by the members of our School Advisory Committee, our Parent
Support Group, our teachers and their families and our present and past
students. Although a small-scale project, the project was meaningful, as
we contributed to the environment as well as supported NParks efforts on
its ‘One Million Trees Movement’.</p>
<p>We started off Term 3 with exuberation, as our students and staff prepared
for our <strong>30th Anniversary Musical titled ‘Kaleidoscope’</strong>.
This was the first time the school produced a musical of this scale to
celebrate the school over the last 30 years. “Kaleidoscope’ captured the
essence of our diverse and vibrant community and celebrated the many unique
talents of our students. In addition, our very own teachers, had composed
and sung the theme song for the musical titled ‘Scaling to New Heights’.
The song debuted at the musical and became the signature song for TNPS,
to be sung at special school events. We are very proud of our students
and staff for providing us with this experience, one that will be reminisced
in the years to come.</p>
<p>‘Kaleidoscope’ is now on Youtube!<strong> </strong>Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fua5bCj34b0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
