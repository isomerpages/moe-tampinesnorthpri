<p>Greetings and well wishes to all as we welcome 2026!</p>
<p>What excites me most about joining this school community is the opportunity
to build upon three decades of excellence while embracing new possibilities.
Since our founding in 1994, Tampines North Primary School has grown significantly,
and this year marks a special milestone as we welcome, for the first time,
10 classes of Primary 1 students to our campus. To all parents entrusting
your child to us, thank you. We recognise the significance of this decision
and are committed to honouring that trust every single day.</p>
<p>To every child who walks through our school gates, I want you to know:
you are special. Whether you're the quiet observer who notices everything
others miss, the energetic leader rallying your classmates during recess,
the creative thinker always asking, "What if?", or the determined problem
solver who never gives up—you belong here. Each of you brings unique talents,
perspectives, and dreams that make our school community richer. Whether
you love mathematics or music, sports or storytelling, science or art,
there is a place here for you to shine. We celebrate not just what you
achieve, but who you are.</p>
<p>To our parents, I want to assure you that this is the best place for your
child. Here, we care deeply for your child—we shape minds, nurture hearts,
build character, and cultivate confidence. Our commitment is to create
an environment where every child feels safe to take risks, supported to
overcome challenges, and encouraged to discover their passions. This means
celebrating the small victories alongside the big ones, providing extra
support when needed, and ensuring that no child feels invisible or left
behind. We are grateful for your partnership in this important work.</p>
<p>I am committed to working alongside my passionate and caring school leadership
team, Mr Mohamed Yusuff, Ms Charmaine Tay and Mr Lim Kian Loo, our dedicated
teachers and support staff, together with our steadfast partners in the
community, to ensure that our school remains a place where every child
knows they belong, where they are valued for who they are, and where they
can grow into the best version of themselves and contribute meaningfully
to the community.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you all—at the school gates, in the corridors,
at school events, and in the many moments that make up our shared journey.
Here's to the wonderful adventures that lie ahead for us in 2026.</p>
<p>With warm regards,</p>
<p>Ms Jamie Ong</p>
