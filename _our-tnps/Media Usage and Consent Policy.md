<h4><strong>Media Usage and Consent Policy</strong></h4>
<p>At Tampines North Primary School, we value the opportunity in celebrating
the meaningful and enriching experiences our students participate in. Photographs
or video recordings of students or their parents/guardians may be taken
during school events and activities such as classroom lessons, CCA, school-wide
events, learning journeys, and other special programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By participating in these school activities and events, students and their
parents/guardians acknowledge that the school may capture, use, and feature
photographs and/or video recordings that include them in school publications,
on the school website, and across social media platforms.</p>
<h4><strong>Showcasing Student Work</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to capturing candid moments, the school may feature student
work across different subjects. This can include academic projects, artwork,
experiments, and other accomplishments that highlight and celebrate our
students' skills and achievements.</p>
<h4><strong>Commitment to Privacy and Respect</strong></h4>
<p>We are committed to respecting the privacy and dignity of all individuals.
Photos and videos are shared exclusively to celebrate achievements and
highlight positive moments. The school carefully selects visuals for public
sharing to uphold our values and present our students, staff, and families
with respect and integrity.</p>
