<h3><strong>Our School Library</strong></h3>
<p>Our school aims to create a vibrant reading culture for our students and
one way is to provide access to a wide variety of quality books. The students
can go to the library during the scheduled library periods, recess or after
school.</p>
<p>Our library is also equipped with the OPAC service for students to browse
the library catalogue and the School e-Resource Repository (SeRR) for online
stories.</p>

</p>
<p>Our school library has different sections to cater to the different reading
levels and needs of our students: Picture Books, Easy Fiction, Fiction,
Non Fiction, Mother Tongue Languages and Magazines. Students can refer
to the bright letterings to help them locate the sections.</p>
