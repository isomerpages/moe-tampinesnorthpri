<h3><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>To provide a platform for parents to partner with the school to work on
programmes and projects that will benefit the students.</p>
<p>These includes tapping on parents' expertise to share with the school,
staff and student, as well as being actively involved through school volunteer
work so as to provide an enriching and holistic education for the students.</p>

<h3><strong>What does it mean to be a PSG in TNPS?</strong></h3>
<p>I envision a strong, cohesive and lively partnership between parents and
the school. I hope that the presence of the PSG in supporting the school’s
programmes and our active involvement in the kids’ lives would make a difference
and make school a little safer and happier for all our kids in TNPS. Come
and join us, get to know other fun parents in the PSG and be a part of
this family. We welcome you!</p>

<p>I love to be part of PSG in Tampines North Primary School. Whenever there’s
duty in school , we as PSG members are always looking forward to help.
I gain lots of knowledge. I enjoy spending time with the children. Being
in the TNPSG , I always feel it’s part of my home. I hope more parents
can join us as TNPSG members.</p>

<p>My decision to become part of TNPS PSG is to build partnership with the
school. Participation and involvement in school activities help to ease
the teachers’ workload too. I would also like to encourage parents who
have the students’ interests at heart and passionate about service, can
consider joining PSGs. You will be able to support and guide your child
better in his or her school life. By joining our TNPS PSG, you will also
gain the support from other parents in your parenting endeavour through
this. So, let’s be kind whenever possible!</p>

<p>PSG provides me with parenting skills, an increased sense of empowerment
and a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage parents to join in PSG as you will be better able
to support and guide your child when you are well-informed about what is
going on in your child’s school. By joining a PSG, you will also gain the
support from other parents in your parenting endeavor.</p>
