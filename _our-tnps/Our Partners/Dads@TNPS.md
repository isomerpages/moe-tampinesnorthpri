<h3>Dads@TNPS</h3>
<p>Launching with the Primary 1 cohort in 2026, Dads@TNPS seeks to strengthen
transition support by engaging fathers as active partners in their children's
educational journey. Guided by the vision “Strong Fathers, Supportive Families,
Thriving Students” and the mission “To inspire fathers to strengthen their
families,” the programme aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Equip fathers with practical knowledge and skills to support their children
through primary school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create meaningful platforms for fathers to bond with their children.</p>
</li>
</ul>
