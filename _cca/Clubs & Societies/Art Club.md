In the TNPS Art Club, the student is the centre of our learning experiences. We hope that our Art Club members not only enjoy artmaking but will also grow as confident learners and active contributors.

Through a range of learning experiences focused on exploration and experimentation, students are exposed to both traditional and current artmaking techniques. Some past activities include soap and paper making, tie and dye, pottery, embroidery, airbrush painting and Claymation. Learning also takes place outside the classroom through visits to museums, artistsâ€™ studios and exhibitions.

Opportunities to develop our students SEL competencies are embedded in collaborative artmaking activities and community projects such as sewing masks for our frontliners during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
