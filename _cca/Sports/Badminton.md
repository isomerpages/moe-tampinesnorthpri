Badminton is a popular physical sports CCA in TNPS. Badminton offers a great workout while testing players' endurance, stamina, flexibility and hand-foot coordination. During practice, students can expect to expend their energy through a healthy outlet and build strength during each session. With 6 badminton courts in the school hall, students can look forward to fun-filled drills or games during practice, rain or shine!

  

New players with little or no prior experience in playing badminton will learn fundamental strokes required to play a short rally. Under the watchful eyes of the instructor and teacher-coach, these students will progress to the next level in no time with hard work and dedication. Most importantly, students pratice the school values taught in classroom such as Integrity, Care, Responsibilty, Respect and Resilience through training routines, games, tournaments and facilitation activities.
