Football is one of the most popular sports in the world. This is a team sport which places an emphasis on teamwork and sportsmanship. The football CCA aims to nurture and develop our students to play the game regularly after they have acquired the fundamental skills. In doing so, we hope that our students will strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle through the enjoyment of playing football. Training sessions are tailored to meet the demands of playing in a competitive match i.e. physical fitness, technical ability and tactical awareness. Students learn and practise school values like respect, responsibility, perseverance and sportsmanship during training sessions and competitions. They are taught the rules of football and basic football skills like dribbling, passing, shooting, moving into space, attacking and defending. Communication and leadership skills are developed as students learn to play as a team.
