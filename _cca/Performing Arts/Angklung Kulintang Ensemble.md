The Angklung Kulintang Ensemble started out humbly in 2007 with only 20 pupils. To date, we now have about 34 P4 to P6 Angklung members. We have been participating in the biennial SYF Arts Presentation held at The Republic Cultural Centre and have been awarded Distinction for the past 5 editions. In 2020, our students were invited to grace the National Day Observance Ceremony held at The Treasury Building where they had the opportunity to interact with some of our Ministers. We hope our Angklung Kulintang ensemble will continue to instil the love and passion for music in every TNPS student.
