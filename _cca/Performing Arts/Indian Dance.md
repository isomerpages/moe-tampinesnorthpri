Indian dance in Tampines North Primary School aims to provide an enriching learning experience of the different dance genres. We also aim to provide students the opportunity to showcase their talents through various platforms. Students learn the fundamental dance movements of different genres, develop flexibilty and coordination skills. Leadership and school values are also taught during dance practice sessions to develop students holistically.
