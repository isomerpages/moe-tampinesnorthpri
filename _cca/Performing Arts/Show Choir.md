<p>Since its inception in 2020, the TNPS Show Choir has enthralled students
with an extensive and integrated musical experience. Focusing on the basics
of singing, dancing and drama, it consists of students who come together
because of their passion for music. The sessions allow students to develop
self-expression and social awareness through various song genres. They
are sensitised to the aesthetics, develop musicality and creativity, and
are given opportunities to stand up and shine. Using the acronym TN (for
Tampines North), we christened our Show Choir Treble Norte to signify our
aspiration to strive for greater heights!</p>
