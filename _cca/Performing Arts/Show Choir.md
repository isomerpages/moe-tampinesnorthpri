Since its inception in 2020, the TNPS Show Choir has enthralled students with an extensive and integrated musical experience. Focusing on the basics of singing, dancing and drama, it consists of students who come together because of their passion for music. The sessions allow students to develop self-expression and social awareness through various song genres. They are sensitised to the aesthetics, develop musicality and creativity, and are given opportunities to stand up and shine. Using the acronym TN (for Tampines North), we christened our Show Choir Treble Norte to signify our aspiration to strive for greater heights!
