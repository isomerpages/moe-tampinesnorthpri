<h3><strong>Lower Primary Reading Support Programme</strong></h3>
<p>The Lower Primary Reading Programme aims to inculcate the love of reading
through story appreciation. It adopts a spiral learning approach whereby
selected students will strengthen their word recognition and the reading
of sentences before they progress to reading of created short stories aligned
to the new English Language syllabus. Students are given many opportunities
to practise their reading in order to develop their confidence and fluency.
Each studentâ€™s progress is closely monitored to improve their reading proficiency.</p>
