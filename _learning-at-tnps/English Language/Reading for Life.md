after their meals. The books are carefully selected around engaging themes
to spark curiosity and cater to diverse reading interests. Library on Wheels
encourages a love for reading in a relaxed and accessible environment.</p>

to enjoy engaging and interactive stories during recess. By making reading
fun and accessible outside the classroom, this initiative sparked their
imagination and helped nurture a lifelong love for books, building confident
and enthusiastic young readers.</p>
