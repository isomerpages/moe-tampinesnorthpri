<h4><strong>English Week</strong></h4>
<p>English Week is a key annual programme designed to celebrate and promote
students' love for the English Language. Each year, the event revolves
around a unique and engaging theme that encourages students to explore
and express their creativity through language.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, students participate in a variety of carefully planned
activities that develop both their writing and speaking skills. A strong
emphasis is placed on oracy, with students given meaningful opportunities
to present their original work to peers through classroom presentations
and school-wide exhibitions.</p>
<p>More than just a celebration of language, English Week nurtures vital
21st-century competencies such as collaboration and confidence in communication,
making it a meaningful and memorable part of the school's English Language
experience.</p>
