##### **Appreciating Literature through Talk (ALT)**

  

At TNPS, we believe that language in the written form opens up new worlds and ideas for the students. As such, they are exposed to quality literature of various genres and given opportunities to respond to the texts using the inquiry through dialogue approach.

Interaction with the texts through dialogue will allow students to:

(i)   Enhance meaning-making   
(ii)  Hone critical thinking skills   
(iii) Respond in creative and meaningful ways

##### **English Week**

Held annually, the English Week aims to provide students with opportunities to showcase their writing and speaking skills creatively. Taking on different themes each year, a host of activities are held in that week to tickle the students’ literary bones. Students are also given opportunities and platforms to create and perform in that week.
