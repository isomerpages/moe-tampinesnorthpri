<h3><strong>Appreciating Literature through Talk (ALT)</strong></h3>
<p>At TNPS, we believe that language in the written form opens up new worlds
and ideas for the students. As such, they are exposed to quality literature
of various genres and given opportunities to respond to the texts using
the inquiry through dialogue approach.</p>
<p>Interaction with the texts through dialogue will allow students to:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;Enhance meaning-making
<br>(ii)&nbsp; Hone critical thinking skills
<br>(iii) Respond in creative and meaningful ways</p>
<p></p>

<h4><strong>English Week</strong></h4>
<p>Held annually, the English Week aims to provide students with opportunities
to showcase their writing and speaking skills creatively. Taking on different
themes each year, a host of activities are held in that week to tickle
the studentsâ€™ literary bones. Students are also given opportunities and
platforms to create and perform in that week.</p>
