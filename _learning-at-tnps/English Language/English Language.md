<h3><strong>Confident, Effective and Responsible Communicators</strong></h3>
<p>TNPS English teachers seek to deliver an engaging curriculum through the
5As approach to help students develop positive learning dispositions and
acquire language skills to be confident and effective users of the language
that will empower them to learn for life.</p>

<p>The English Syllabus (2020) aims to make learning relevant for our students
in the 21st century context. It focuses on building stronger fundamentals
while equipping our students to learn for life.</p>
<p>The three desired learner outcomes of the ELS 2020 Syllabus are:
<br>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;An Empathetic Communicator
<br>(ii)&nbsp; A Discerning Reader
<br>(iii) A Creative Inquirer</p>

<p>At TNPS, we adopt the Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading
(STELLAR), a national pedagogic framework, in the learning of the English
Language. Using authentic literature, the STELLAR approach seeks to build
strong fundamentals by helping students to make a strong reading-writing
connection through a whole-part-whole process.</p>
