<h3><strong>National Education @ TNPS</strong></h3>
<p>National Education is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop
national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and
instil in our students, confidence in our nationâ€™s future. It also emphasises
on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.</p>
<p>In TNPS, we aim to engage students through a shared and narrative approach
that includes voices and experiences from our students. We design learning
experiences that allows students to build stronger relationships with their
peers and enhance their citizenship experiences through many NE activities
and programmes.</p>
<p>Students will take part in NE events such as the 4 NE commemorative days
(Total Defence Day / International Friendship Day / Racial Harmony Day
/ National Day), Assembly programmes, Cohort Learning Journey, NE Show
and NE quiz etc. These experiences develop our students to be engaged citizens
who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking who can play a contributory
role in the community and towards the nation.</p>
