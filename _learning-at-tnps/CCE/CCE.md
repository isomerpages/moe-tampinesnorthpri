#### To be students of good character and values who care for and contribute actively to their family, school and nation
The school adopts a whole school approach to broaden studentsâ€™ experiences in character and citizenship education.

The CCE Curriculum focuses on using the V3 (Values Inculcation, Values In Action and Values Reflection) to equip students with the knowledge, skills and attitudes/values necessary to develop them to be Confident Learners and Critical Thinkers, Rooted in Values.

Age-appropriate learning experiences are created for students to apply the values they have learnt, make decisions and act on them in a responsible way.
