<p>Our children are growing up with a wide range of influences through the
internet. Sexuality Education aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop healthy relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others
by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that
are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) supports Sexuality Education
by teaching students to manage interpersonal relationships. Sexuality Education
is conducted for the Primary 5 and 6 students through the Growing Years
Programme which covers the physical, emotional, social and ethical aspects
of sexuality.</p>
