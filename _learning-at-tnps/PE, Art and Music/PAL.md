##### To nurture students to be confident, arouse their curiosity and instil cooperative skills that encourages team work.


The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is part of the curriculum and students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences in four domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. Students also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision making. PAL nurtures confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills in students. This is done primarily through Experiential learning which is defined as "learning through reflection on doing". PAL creates authentic socialisation experiences for acquisition of SE competencies and facilitate holistic development.

  

Curriculum would include aspects of Experiential learning as follow:

  

1.  Mixture of content and process: A balance between the experiential activities and the underlying content.
2.  Absence of excessive judgment: a safe space for students to work through their own process of self-discovery.
3.  Engagement in purposeful endeavors: In experiential learning, the learner is the self-teacher, therefore there must be “meaning for the student in the learning.” The learning activities must be personally relevant to the student.
4.  The presence of meaningful relationships. This could include, for instance, “being accountable for one’s actions and owning the consequences”

  

  

PAL modules embody the following characteristics :

  

*   Experiential in nature
*   Encompass learning in a creative way
*   Provide opportunities for children (individually and in teams) to create
*   Fun and enjoyable
*   Incorporate Character Development and Social Emotional Learning (e.g. self-discovery, self-respect, respect for others, team work and leadership)

  

Using “Environment Education” as the foundation of our design, students have been learning more about ‘Reusing, Reducing and Recycling’ as well as appreciating nature and the environment. We aim to instil the 3Cs (Creativity, Curiosity and Confidence) in our students through the PAL programme.

  

In 2021, the school embarked on Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for the Primary 1 and 2 pupils. Using “Environment Education” as the foundation of our design and the theme “The Flight of Life”, pupils have been learning more about ‘Reusing, Reducing and Recycling’ as well as appreciating nature and the environment.
