<p>TNPS PAM teachers aim to develop our students in 2 domains – physical
and aesthetics (体、美). Through Physical Education lessons, we hope to nurture
our students to adopt positive and lifelong attitudes of a healthy lifestyle.
With a varied and customised Aesthetics programme, our students learn to
appreciate and enjoy the arts.</p>
