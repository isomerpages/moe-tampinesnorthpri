<p>The music programme aims to foster appreciation and talent for music through
exposure to a wide range of music genres. Through participation in the
school- based activities, students acquire basic knowledge and skills in
the performing arts. We also aim to help our students recognize and respect
cultural diversity presented in the different performing art forms.</p>
