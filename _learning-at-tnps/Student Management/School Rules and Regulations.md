<h4><strong>School Rules and Regulations</strong></h4>
<p><em>To ensure a shared understanding of our expectations and to support our partnership in your child's growth, please refer to the </em><strong><em>Student Handbook</em></strong><em> for detailed school rules and regulations.</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Our Discipline Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong> We adopt a positive and proactive approach,
focusing on building self-discipline, good character and strong relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restorative Practice:</strong> We emphasize a restorative process
– using restitution, resolution, and reconciliation to heal relationships
after conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To create a safe, orderly, and caring environment
where every student can grow into a responsible and respectful individual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2. Attendance &amp; Punctuality</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Reporting Time:</strong> Students must report to school punctually
by <strong>7.30 a.m.</strong> Latecomers must report to the General Office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Absence:</strong> A Medical Certificate (MC) or a letter from a
parent/guardian stating the reason for absence must be produced when a
student is absent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Term Time:</strong> Parents/Guardians should not take their child/ward
away from school for holidays before the end of the school term or return
after the start of a term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Personal Electronic Devices (Handphones &amp; Smartwatches)</strong>
</p>
<p>To help maintain a focused and productive learning environment, we seek
the support of parents/guardians in ensuring that these personal electronic
devices with communication and image-capturing abilities are not a distraction
during curriculum hours.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Usage Policy: </strong>Students are not allowed to use mobile
phones and/or smartwatches during school hours including recess, CCA, and
after-school programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Exception: </strong>The POSB Smart Buddy Watch is permitted
as it is a non-telecommunication device, which allows contactless payment
in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage: </strong>If brought to school, devices must be switched
off and kept out of sight during curriculum hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsibility: </strong>Students bear full responsibility for
the safekeeping of their devices. The school is not liable for any loss,
theft, or damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urgent Matters: </strong>If you need to contact your child urgently,
please call the General Office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consequences: </strong>Any device used during curriculum hours
will be confiscated. Confiscated devices must be personally collected by
a parent/guardian from a staff member.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><em>Quick Note for Parents on Social Media: Please be reminded that your child must be at least 13 years old to register for and use apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and TikTok. To prevent social friction and maintain a positive school culture, students are not allowed to manage school-related WhatsApp chat groups.</em>
