<h4><strong>School Rules and Regulations</strong></h4>
<p><em>To ensure a shared understanding of our expectations and to support our partnership in your child's growth, please refer to the </em><strong><em>Student Handbook</em></strong><em> for detailed school rules and regulations.</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Our Discipline Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong> We adopt a positive and proactive approach,
focusing on building self-discipline, good character and strong relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restorative Practice:</strong> We emphasize a restorative process
– using restitution, resolution, and reconciliation to heal relationships
after conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To create a safe, orderly, and caring environment
where every student can grow into a responsible and respectful individual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2. Attendance &amp; Punctuality</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Reporting Time:</strong> Students must report to school punctually
by <strong>7.30 a.m.</strong> Latecomers must report to the General Office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Absence:</strong> A Medical Certificate (MC) or a letter from a
parent/guardian stating the reason for absence must be produced when a
student is absent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Term Time:</strong> Parents/Guardians should not take their child/ward
away from school for holidays before the end of the school term or return
after the start of a term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Personal Electronic Devices (Handphones &amp; Smartwatches)</strong>
</p>
<p>To help maintain a focused and productive learning environment, we seek
the support of parents/guardians in ensuring that these personal electronic
devices with communication and image-capturing abilities are not a distraction
during curriculum hours.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Usage Policy: </strong>Students are not allowed to use mobile
phones and/or smartwatches during school hours including recess, CCA, and
after-school programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Exception: </strong>The POSB Smart Buddy Watch is permitted
as it is a non-telecommunication device, which allows contactless payment
in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage: </strong>If brought to school, devices must be switched
off and kept out of sight during curriculum hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsibility: </strong>Students bear full responsibility for
the safekeeping of their devices. The school is not liable for any loss,
theft, or damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urgent Matters: </strong>If you need to contact your child urgently,
please call the General Office.</p>
</li>
</ul>
