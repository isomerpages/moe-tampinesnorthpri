<p>At TNPS, we believe students learn best in a safe, orderly and caring
environment. We balance clear expectations with encouragement and support,
helping students grow into responsible, respectful individuals.</p>
<p>We take on a positive and proactive approach to discipline, focusing on
building self-discipline, good character, and strong relationships. We
guide students to reflect on their actions, learn from mistakes, and make
better choices through care, corrective support, and the teaching of values
and social-emotional skills.</p>
<p>Disciplinary actions are not meant to punish, but to help students understand
consequences, take responsibility, and make amends. We emphasise fairness
and growth—restoring relationships through restitution, resolution, and
reconciliation.</p>
<p>In serious cases, we take firm action to protect the well-being of all
students and staff. Our goal is always to support every child’s development
in a safe and respectful school community.</p>
<p>In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline in the school,
we consider the three aspects.</p>

<p>We work closely with parents and the wider school community to nurture
a culture anchored on the school values – Integrity, Care, Respect, Resilience
and Responsibility. Together, we can guide our children to become confident
and values-driven learners, ready to thrive in school and beyond.
