<p>At our school, the <strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong> is
an integral part of our efforts to develop well-rounded students with strong
social and emotional competencies. Targeted at Primary 1 and 2 students,
PAL provides joyful and meaningful learning experiences beyond the academic
classroom, laying a strong foundation for character development and lifelong
learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Focus on Social-Emotional Learning</strong></h3>
<p>PAL is designed to nurture values, social skills, and emotional well-being
in our young learners. Through collaborative and hands-on activities, students
learn to communicate effectively, build positive relationships, manage
emotions, and make responsible decisions — all essential skills in today’s
dynamic world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Modules Offered</strong></h3>

and infused with opportunities for self-discovery, teamwork, and creativity:</p>
