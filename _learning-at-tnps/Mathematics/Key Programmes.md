<h5><strong><u>Department Programmes</u></strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Financial Literacy Programme (FLP)</strong>&nbsp;is an in-house
programme that is conducted for all levels. Through financial literacy
education, the Mathematics department hopes to equip students with basic
financial knowledge and develop in them good financial habits from an early
age.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Math Explorer Programme</strong>&nbsp;is an enrichment
programme designed for P3 and P4 students who display a strong interest
in Mathematics. The programme provides students with opportunities to work
independently or in teams to engage in mathematical thinking through solving
challenging mathematical tasks.</p>
<p>For P5 and P6 students, the&nbsp;<strong>Mathematical Olympiad Programme</strong>&nbsp;exposes
students to higher order thinking skills through mathematical problem solving
that is usually beyond the primary school syllabus. At the end of the programme,
students participate in Mathematics competitions to benchmark their mathematical
ability against their peers at the cluster or national levels.</p>
