<h3><strong>E2K Mathematics Programme</strong></h3>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning
skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate
with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources
such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed
for this programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme
serve to help students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Math Explorer Programme</strong></h3>
<p>The Math Explorer Programme is an enrichment programme designed for P4
and P5 students who display a strong interest in Mathematics. The programme
provides students with opportunities to work independently or in teams
to engage in mathematical thinking through solving challenging mathematical
tasks.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>P1 and P2 Math Week</strong></h3>
<p>The P1 and P2 Math Week provides opportunities for lower primary students
to improve their mathematics learning through fun activities and challenges.
It helps students see the real-world relevance of Mathematics in everyday
life. Through hands-on activities and competitions, Math Week aims to foster
a joy of learning in students, inspiring them to explore mathematics with
curiosity and enthusiasm. As students work in groups, they also develop
essential life skills such as teamwork and effective communication.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>P3 and P4 Math Trails</strong></h3>
<p>The Math Trails encourages critical thinking and teamwork as students
apply math concepts to real-world situations, making learning fun and meaningful.
In the P3 Math Trail, students explore a mock supermarket setup where they
learn about budgeting and engage with concepts such as mass and volume
through interactive learning stations. The P4 Math Trial takes students
on a journey around the school as they use mathematical concepts and skills
to solve problems within a real-life context.</p>
