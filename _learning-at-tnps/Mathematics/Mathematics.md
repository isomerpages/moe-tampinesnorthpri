<p>At TNPS, the Mathematics department aims to nurture confident problem
solvers who have a strong foundation in numeracy and are passionate in
the learning of the subject.</p>
<p>The Primary Mathematics syllabus aims to enable all students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous
learning in mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive
skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The mathematics framework sets the direction and provides guidance in
the teaching and learning of the mathematics curriculum. The central focus
of the framework is mathematical problem solving. The development of the
ability to use mathematics to solve problems is dependent on five inter-related
components â€“ conceptual understanding, skills proficiency, mathematical
processes, attitudes and metacognition.</p>
