TNPS Mother Tongue teachers envisioned our students to be proficient & confident Mother Tongue Language (MTL) users. We adopted various approaches for learning to equip students with the essential literacy skills.

  

1.  Daily Prelesson Activities conducted includes singing children's songs/poems recitation/tongue twister/hotseats drama technique/charades/games etc to make learning of MTL fun and engaging
2.  Experiential learning approach provide students the platform for authentic learning experience that make using of MTL real and practical
3.  Differentiated approach is blended into the design of daily lessons and tasks assigned to students.Â  It aims to cater for the diversed learning needs of our students.
