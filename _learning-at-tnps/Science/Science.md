<h3><strong>A community of learners, equipped with knowledge and empathy for the environment</strong></h3>
<p>TNPS Science teachers aim to instil in our students a sense of wonder
and lively curiosity for all things around them, with zeal for learning
and knowledge, and imbued with genuine passion and care for the environment.</p>
<p>Our TNPS Science Curriculum is guided by the following Key Features:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A Thematic Approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiential Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holistic Assessment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The national Science curriculum seeks to nurture in students a spirit
of scientific inquiry. At Tampines North Primary School, we achieve this
by building on the school’s Experiential Learning approach to inculcate
in students a sense of curiosity and wonderment about the things around
them. We strive to fuel the natural curiosity in our students by relating
scientific concepts to real life phenomena, and encouraging them to ask
HOW and WHY questions about the world around them. In this way, Science
comes alive and become relevant and meaningful to them.</p>
<h3><strong>TNPS Science Curriculum (P3 to P6)</strong></h3>
<p>The Science curriculum is translated in the classroom through teacher-facilitated
discussions and explanations. Students are engaged in investigative hands-on
activities during Science experiments and Learning Trails, as well as in
articulating their understanding and reflections of different topics through
their reflections at the end of each topic. Students’ skills in explaining
scientific concepts are honed by introducing the Cause-and-Effect Relationhip
and Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) thinking routines. Students also leverage
on ICT tools like tablets, dataloggers and the online simulations to document
their understanding of Science concepts.</p>
