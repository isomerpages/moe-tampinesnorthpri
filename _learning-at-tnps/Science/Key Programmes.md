<h3><strong>Every Child A Seed</strong></h3>
<p>The Every Child A Seed programme was started in 2013 to enable pupils
nationwide to commemorate 50 Years of Greening Singapore. This collaborative
project between NParks and Tampines North Primary conveys to our students
that every Singaporean plays a part in shaping our city in a garden. The
programme also fits seamlessly into the Lower Block Science curriculum,
where it aims to generate greater awareness amongst students about the
life cycle of plants. It is also a good platform for students to practice
the values of care and responsibility while taking care of their growing
plant.</p>

<h3><strong>Life Cycle Comes Alive</strong></h3>
<p>Our Primary 4 students have the opportunity to learn the intricacies of
a life cycle, through the real life experience of observing caterpillars
and mealworms develop into caterpillars and beetles respectively. Students
especially enjoy watching the butterflies emerge from their cocoons for
the first time, before releasing them into the school’s Butterfly Garden.</p>
<p>The Science teachers also observe that the students constantly display
the value of care as they are very motivated to clean and feed the ‘class
pets’.</p>
