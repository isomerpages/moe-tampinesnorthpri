<p>At TNPS, we are committed to nurturing students who are <strong>confident, self-directed, and responsible digital learners</strong>.
Our ICT Department supports this vision through a structured TNPS Digital
Literacy Roadmap that equips students with essential digital competencies
for the 21st century.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Building Digital Foundations from the Start</strong></h3>
<p>From Primary 1, students embark on their digital learning journey with
lessons that include:</p>

have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning basic <strong>touch-typing</strong> skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovering how to access <strong>common online learning platforms</strong>,
such as Padlet and Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Primary 3 and beyond, students gain hands-on experience with:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Google Suite</strong> tools such as Google Slides and Google Doc

<h3><strong>Empowering Teachers to Empower Learners</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure effective student support, we focus on building teachersâ€™ digital
competencies through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Ongoing technical skills training</strong>, including just-in-time
refresher sessions and clinics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>e-Pedagogy professional development</strong>, enabling teachers
to design purposeful and engaging tech-enabled lessons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lesson design support</strong>, helping teachers anticipate student
needs and craft experiences that foster deeper learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Robust Infrastructure for Seamless Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Our ICT environment is supported by a strong digital infrastructure, including
dedicated classroom carts that house Chromebook Personal Learning Devices
(PLDs) for all Primary 4 to 6 students. These learning spaces promote independence,
nurture digital literacy, and empower students to take charge of their
learning in an ever-evolving digital world.</p>
