We strive to provide a positive and encouraging environment to nurture a love for reading in every student. We strongly believe that access to good books is the first step to reach that goal and seek to provide students with multiple opportunities to such access and read for pleasure.

##### **Read@TNPS Library**    
All students head to the school library once a fortnight to read and borrow English books. Our library is well-stocked with interesting and popular titles and students often find themselves spoilt for choice.

 
##### **Partnership with NLB**   
In partnership with NLB to promote the joy of reading, we have adopted some of their programmes like “Books-To-Go”, the school edition of “Book Bugs” and storytelling programmes.

  

##### **Amazing Authors**   
All P1 – P5 students will be exposed to works of renowned authors through a structured class reading programme that introduces them to a curated collection of quality storybooks.

  

##### **D.E.A.R**    
The Drop Everything And Read (D.E.A.R) programme is a sustained silent reading programme during English lessons. It aims to develop fluent readers and ignite interest in reading by providing a designated time for students to read frequently and consistently.
