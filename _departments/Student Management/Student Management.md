#### To develop students with self-discipline and strong values to learn and lead


In TNPS, we aim to develop students to have self-discipline and strong values to learn and lead.

  

Students need an orderly and disciplined environment to learn well. At the same time, a caring, encouraging and safe environment will allow students to learn from their mistakes and improve. Through student-led leadership programs, we aim to promote a culture of care in the school through their peers. On the other hand, a positive, proactive approach to discipline develops students’ readiness and motivation to learn, and enables them to feel safe both physically and psychologically. These two factors in turn create an environment conducive for the students’ learning and development. In TNPS, we focus on promoting positive student behaviour in support of learning and growth through the teaching of values and skills, and timely reinforcement through corrective guidance.
