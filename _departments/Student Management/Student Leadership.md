In TNPS, we believe that:

1.  Every student can be developed as a leader
2.  Student leadership development needs to be intentional and purposeful

  

As a school, we provide trainings, platforms, and opportunities for student leaders to exhibit their leadership capability and skills.

Intended outcome of Student Leadership in TNPS:

1.  Develop student leaders to be confident leaders, critical thinkers, and rooted in values, so as to take on leadership roles purposefully
2.  Provide opportunities for students to impact and bring forth changes and improvement to self, school, community and beyond.

  

Through a problem-solving process, TNPS student leaders learn to collaborate and work together across different leadership portfolios as a unit. In doing so, the student leaders will attain valuable project management skills while making the community a better place.
