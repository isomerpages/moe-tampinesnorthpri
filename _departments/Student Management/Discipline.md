## **Discipline**

In TNPS, we believe in a positive and proactive approach in discipline when we work with our students.

  

**Safe, caring and encouraging environment**

Students learn well when there is order and discipline. Yet at the same time, we want to create an environment that is safe, caring and encouraging for them to learn from their mistakes and improve.

  

**Self-Discipline**

Our goal is to instil self-discipline in our students, ensuring that they are rooted in values. Through teaching of values and skills, and timely reinforcement, we hope to equip our students with necessary social and emotional skills to behave thoughtfully, and be responsible and respectful individuals.

  

**Take responsibility for their actions**

At TNPS, we help students understand that their actions carry consequences, and they must learn to take responsibility for their actions. Students also learn to take responsibility of their actions through restitution, resolution, and reconciliation when they make poor choices.
