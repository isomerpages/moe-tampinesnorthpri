### Every Child A Seed

The Every Child A Seed programme was started in 2013 to enable pupils nationwide to commemorate 50 Years of Greening Singapore. This collaborative project between NParks and Tampines North Primary conveys to our students that every Singaporean plays a part in shaping our city in a garden. The programme also fits seamlessly into the Lower Block Science curriculum, where it aims to generate greater awareness amongst students about the life cycle of plants. It is also a good platform for students to practice the values of care and responsibility while taking care of their growing plant.

### Life Cycle Comes Alive


Our Primary 4 students have the opportunity to learn the intricacies of a life cycle, through the real life experience of observing caterpillars and mealworms develop into caterpillars and beetles respectively. Students especially enjoy watching the butterflies emerge from their cocoons for the first time, before releasing them into the school’s Butterfly Garden.

The Science teachers also observe that the students constantly display the value of care as they are very motivated to clean and feed the ‘class pets’.
