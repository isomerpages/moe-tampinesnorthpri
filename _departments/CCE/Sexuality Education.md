Our children are growing up with a wide range of influences through the internet. Sexuality Education aims to:

1.  Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop healthy relationships.
2.  Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.
3.  Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.

  

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) supports Sexuality Education by teaching students to manage interpersonal relationships. Sexuality Education is conducted for the Primary 5 and 6 students through the Growing Years Programme which covers the physical, emotional, social and ethical aspects of sexuality.
