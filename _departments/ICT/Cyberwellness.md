Cyberwellnes in Character and Citizen Education (CCE) aims to equip TNPS students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of technology and ICT to maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and navigate the cyberspace in a safe manner. The school adapts MOE’s Sense-Think-Act framework to develop pupils’ instinct to protect and empower them to take responsibility for their well-being in cyberspace. The two principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’ and ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ when adhered to will anchor pupils’ well-being in cyberspace as they will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

  

To help your child/ward stay safe and have positive experiences online, you can:

  

*   Activate parental controls on your home devices;
*   Model good digital habits for your child/ward;
*   Set ground rules for internet use; and
*   Navigate the internet together to understand their usage.
