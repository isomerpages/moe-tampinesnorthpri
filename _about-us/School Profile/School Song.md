**OUR SCHOOL SONG**  

  

At Tampines North Primary School   
Our aim is to be Noble and True    
Our goal is to strive   
To reach for the star    
To shine forth both near and far   
Each of us will heed the call   
To be a light for one and all    
Steadfast and worthy we'll want to be

 
A gleaming example for all to see.   
For our country we’ll do our best.    
With shields up right we’ll stand the test.    
With our mind and body, spirit and soul.   
We’ll go all out to reach our goals   
at Tampines North Primary School!
