The safety of our students and staff are of utmost importance.

Our school has customised programmes to educate students on safety matters. For instance, as part of the orientation programme, all P1 students are taught to cross the road safely. After the formal theory lesson in the classroom, P1 students head to the traffic junction outside the school for practice under the watchful eyes of our parent volunteers and teachers.

Structures are put in place to address safety issues. Comprehensive safety standard operational procedures are also drawn up and implemented. An example is the emergency evacuation exercise that the school population undergoes yearly to be familiar with the procedures.

We seek continual improvement in school safety. The school is responsive to feedback from stakeholders to rectify safety concerns to provide a conducive learning for our students.
