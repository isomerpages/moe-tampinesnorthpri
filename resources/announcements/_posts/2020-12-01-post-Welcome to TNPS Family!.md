Dear Parents/Guardians,

[Letter to P1 Parents](http://tampinesnorthpri-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/qql/slot/u513/parents/2021/Parent%20Letter%20P1%202021.pdf "P1 Letter to Parents 2021")

Welcome to Tampines North Primary School family. We are looking forward to your child joining us on 4 Jan 2021. I am sure that you are excited about your child’s first day at school. Primary school is definitely an important milestone in their educational journey. Thank you for choosing Tampines North Primary as your choice school and providing us the opportunity to share this next milestone with you. Please refer to the letter attached for more details.

Home- School partnership is important to your child’s development. Our students succeed when schools and parents work hand in hand to support students in learning self-management skills, taking responsibility and building resilience. We seek your support to help us focus on these areas at home as well so that our students can be independent and take ownership of themselves. Hence, we are looking forward to work together to positively impact our children in 2021. Here’s wishing everyone a “Happy New Year” and see you on 4 Jan.

Thank you.

Your Partner in Education,  
Mrs Ratna Elangovan (Principal, Tampines North Primary School)
