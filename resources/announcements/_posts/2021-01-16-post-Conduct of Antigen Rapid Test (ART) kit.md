Dear Parents,

Your child was issued 3 sets of the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kit yesterday. As part of familiarizing ourselves with the use of the kit, parents are encouraged to conduct the test with their children. There is no reporting required. We have attached a video link [http://go.gov.sg/art-instructions](http://go.gov.sg/art-instructions) that will guide you step by step. More information is provided in the attached letter. If you have any queries, do feel free to call the school and we will advise you accordingly. Thank you for your support and stay safe.

Regards,    
Ratna Elangovan
