### ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION (EE)
Environmental Education (EE) is the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP). It focuses on developing the students' character and fulfilling our social responsibility to society to ensure a more sustainable environment.

Our students are provided with opportunities and experiences to engage in environmental care at home, in school, in the neighbourhood and the community.

Students learn about the importance of water and the resources on Earth through various activities and games and water-rationing exercise.

They then do their part by pledging to take home the conservation methods they have learnt in school.

### GREEN CHAMPIONS
The faces of Environmental Education (EE) in TNPS, our Green Champions, engage in active discussions and undergo training to broaden their knowledge on environmental issues. They then pass on their learning to their fellow schoolmates through various EE events in school.

To spread the school's EE messages to the public, the students often participated in community events such as the Tampines GRC Learning Festival. Our students engaged actively with the public to rethink our habits, refuse single-use products, reuse several times, reduce wastage, repair if possible and recycle right!
