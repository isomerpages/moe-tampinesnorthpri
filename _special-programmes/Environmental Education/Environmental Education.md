### ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION (EE)
Environmental Education (EE) is the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP). It focuses on developing the students' character and fulfilling our social responsibility to society to ensure a more sustainable environment.

Our students are provided with opportunities and experiences to engage in environmental care at home, in school, in the neighbourhood and the community.
