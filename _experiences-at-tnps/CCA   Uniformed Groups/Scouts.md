Through Scouting, Cub Scouts discover, learn and put into practice essential life skills through serving others and learning by doing.

They develop leadership skills and confidence, empowering them to make positive contributions to the school and society through a range of exciting activities, such as outdoor cooking and Job Week.

With the acquisition of the new knowledge and skills, the Cub Scouts become more confident and competent to lead their peers in activities. Through engagement in planned activities, Cub Scouts develop their character as they grow progressively and holistically.
