<p>In Malay Dance, students are exposed to the different genres of both contemporary
and traditional dances namely Inang, Joget, Zapin, Asli and Masri. There
are various platforms for our students to showcase their talents and hone
their art. To date, our students have performed at various schools and
community events and also participated in the Singapore Youth Festival.
We hope the practices and exposure will ignite their passion in learning
the traditional art of Malay Dance in a supportive environment.</p>
