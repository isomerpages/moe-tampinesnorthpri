<h3><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION (EE)</strong></h3>
<p>Environmental Education (EE) is the school's Learning for Life Programme
(LLP). It focuses on developing the students' character and fulfilling
our social responsibility to society to ensure a more sustainable environment.</p>
<p>Our students are provided with opportunities and experiences to engage
in environmental care at home, in school, in the neighbourhood and the
community.</p>

<h3><strong>G4LIFE WEEK</strong></h3>
<p>Students learn about the importance of water and the resources on Earth
through various activities and games and water-rationing exercise.</p>
<p>They then do their part by pledging to take home the conservation methods
they have learnt in school.</p>
<h3><strong>GREEN CHAMPIONS</strong></h3>
<p>The faces of Environmental Education (EE) in TNPS, our Green Champions,
engage in active discussions and undergo training to broaden their knowledge
on environmental issues. They then pass on their learning to their fellow
schoolmates through various EE events in school.</p>
<h3><strong>COMMUNITY OUTREACH</strong></h3>
<p>To spread the school's EE messages to the public, the students often participated
in community events such as the Tampines GRC Learning Festival. Our students
engaged actively with the public to rethink our habits, refuse single-use
products, reuse several times, reduce wastage, repair if possible and recycle

<p>For the Tray Return Initiative, the students went to Our Tampines Hub
(OTH) and encouraged the public to return the trays after their meals.
By doing so, we can keep our environment clean and green.</p>

<p>The students also grew and harvested vegetables from the school's Green
Food Garden. The harvested vegetables were then delivered to the community
fridges to share with the residents.</p>
