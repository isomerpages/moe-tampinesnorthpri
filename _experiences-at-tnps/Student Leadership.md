<p>At TNPS. we believe that every student has the potential to lead. It begins
with self-leadership and develops into leading others with confidence and
purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Student Leadership Vision:</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to develop student leaders who are confident, values-driven,
and equipped with critical thinking skills to contribute meaningfully to
the school and community.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Student Leadership Model:</strong></h3>
<p>A tiered progression is in place to support students in developing and
demonstrating leadership competencies to lead themselves and others. This
is achieved through the CCE curriculum, school-wide programmes and dedicated
leadership training modules for our student leaders. Students are also
given opportunities to drive positive change and contribute meaningfully
within the school and the wider community.</p>
