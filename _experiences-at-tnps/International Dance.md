<p>International Dance CCA aims to nurture and groom students to excel in
modern dance. We hope to ignite the passion for dancing in our students.
Our students are exposed to different dance genres as they learn a variety
of dance moves and techniques. During the practice sessions, our students
learn and practise the school values of resilience and responsibility.
We provide multiple platofrms for students to participate in performances
and competitions to hone their dance techniques.</p>
