<h4><strong>What is Student iCON?</strong></h4>
<p>Student iCON is a suite of Google apps (which includes an email account,
Google Classroom, Google Docs, Google Slides, etc) that helps to better
support students’ learning and collaboration with others.</p>

<h4><strong>How do I log in?</strong></h4>

</p>
<p><strong>Username: This is your student iCON email address.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Student’s email address will be based on (Full Name)@students.edu.sg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any space in the full name will be replaced with an underscore.</p>
</li>

<p>Should the student’s full name have words such as “Bte” and “s/o”, they
will not appear in the email address.</p>
