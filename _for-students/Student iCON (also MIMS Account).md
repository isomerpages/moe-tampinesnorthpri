<h4><strong>What is Student iCON?</strong></h4>
<p>Student iCON is a suite of Google apps (which includes an email account,
Google Classroom, Google Docs, Google Slides, etc) that helps to better
support students’ learning and collaboration with others.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>How do I log in?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Website: </strong><a href="https://workspace.google.com/dashboard" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://workspace.google.com/dashboard</u></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Username: </strong>This is your student iCON email address.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Student’s email address will be based on (Full Name)@students.edu.sg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any space in the full name will be replaced with an underscore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the student’s full name have words such as “Bte” and “s/o”, they
will not appear in the email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For cases where students share the same full name, we have added a numerical
number (e.g. Jon_Tan_1, Jon_Tan_2) to differentiate their email addresses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You also will use this email address as your username for MIMS. MIMS helps
you log in to different apps and services using the same ID and password.
These include logging into school Chromebooks, SLS, and Microsoft Office
apps.</p>
